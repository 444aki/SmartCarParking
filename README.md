The proposed work focuses on the development of a smart car parking fee collection
system that utilizes a combination of Arduino Uno, ESP32, RFID sensors, servo
motor, and LDR sensors to provide an efficient and automated solution for parking
management. The proposed system aims to enhance the user experience, streamline
the payment process, and offer real-time analytics for parking administrators. The
system's key features include user authentication, automated barrier control, timerbased
fee calculation, email notification, and smart lighting control. This paper
presents the detailed design, implementation, and evaluation of the proposed system,
showcasing its effectiveness in addressing the challenges associated with traditional
parking management systems.
